This is the website for the NPO Open Hart Paal.

This is an initial draft/recommendation. Most pictures are placeholder, and texts are copied from the older website pending approval/re-write.
The primary goal of this preliminary version is to see if it matches the desired look and feel, and makes it more accessible to the target audience

There was a deliberate choice to keep things as simple as possible, opting for a static HTML page.
